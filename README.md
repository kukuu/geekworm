# Build Real Web App with React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
## Developing Components in Isolation

Usually, in an app, you have a lot of UI components, and each of them has many different states.
For an example, a simple button component could have following states:

* In a regular state, with a text label.
* In the disabled mode.
* In a loading state.

Usually, it’s hard to see these states without running a sample app or some examples.

Create React App doesn’t include any tools for this by default, but you can easily add [Storybook for React](https://storybook.js.org) ([source](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook)) or [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) ([source](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist)) to your project. **These are third-party tools that let you develop components and see all their states in isolation from your app**.

You can also deploy your Storybook or style guide as a static app. This way, everyone in your team can view and review different states of UI components without starting a backend server or creating an account in your app.

### Getting Started with Storybook

Storybook is a development environment for React UI components. It allows you to browse a component library, view the different states of each component, and interactively develop and test components.

First, install the following npm package globally:

```sh
npm install -g @storybook/cli
```

Then, run the following command inside your app’s directory:

```sh
getstorybook
```

After that, follow the instructions on the screen.
